## Awesome Friday Trailer Park

This is a React App created with `create-react-app` that searches The Movie Database for movie details and trailer links, and then displays them.

Designed to be a tool for myself to more easily search out trailers and basic information.

- Loads popular movies from The Movie Database.
- Queries The Movie Database when a search parameter is entereed, and only displays results if there are any.
- Displays the header image, cast and director information, synopsis, and available trailers for a selected movie.

### To Do:

- Streaming links for movies.
- More movie details loaded.
- Mobile styling.
